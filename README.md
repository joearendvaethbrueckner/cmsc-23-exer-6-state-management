# B. Application Description
A simple application showcasing simple state management in flutter.

# C. Code
I added another page called checkout to the routes and used the provider functionality in order to retrieve the data of the cart and update the checkout screen accordingly.

# D. Challenges
The challenge in this exercise is choosing the right approach when using the provider package. It is whether you want to use the read, watch, or consumer functionality of the provider package. However, once you get used to their differences, it becomes fairly easy to use and improves the development process.
